# DVD_Rental_System
C++ DVD rental system project created as part of a object oriented programming subject at university.

Simple movie rental system based on .txt files with user and admin types accounts. 
The program is used to store data about movies owned by a movie rental company on a physical medium such as DVD. 
It allows storing information about the films owned by the rental company, such as director, release date, cast or
number of media owned. In addition, it allows you to log in to the program as a customer, which allows you to browse
through available movies, view information about them, rent or return a movie, and view your account information or a
list of movies rented by the customer. In addition to the customer account, there are also administrator accounts. These, in
turn, allow to view information on who rented what film or display a list of films not returned on time. Most importantly,
however, they allow to add a new movie to the rental service and edit information about the movie or the clientâ€™s account.
In addition, it is also possible to create user accounts from within the program.
